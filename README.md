## Basics

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a container technology: A tool for creating and managing containers.
  - <b>Environment: </b> The runtimes, languages & frameworks
  - Development environment and production environment are often not the same
- <b>Virtual Machines</b>

| :--------------------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|                      Separated environments                      |                    Redundant duplication, waste of space                    |
|         Environment-specific configurations are possible         |               Performance can be slow, boot times can be long               |
| Environment configurations can be shared and reproduced reliably | Reproducing on another computer/ server is possible but may still be tricky |

|                     Docker Containers                      |                        Virtual Machines                         |
| :--------------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------: |
|   Low impact on OS, very fast, minimal disk space usage    |      Bigger impact on OS, slower, higher disk space usage       |
|       Sharing, re-building and distribution is easy        |    Sharing, re-building and distribution can be challenging     |
| Encapsulate apps/ environments instead of "whole machines" | Encapsulate "whole machines" instead of just apps/ environments |
